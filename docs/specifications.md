# Specifications

## Purpose
The purpose of this website is to provide recruiters with the basics — my name, resume, and email.

## Requirements
- Single page with my name, link to my resume, and my email.
- Info is easy to find — front and center with no scrolling necessary.
- Development and hosting of the website is as cheap as possible.
- Website is highly available.
- Website is continuously integrated with a development, staging, and production environment.
- Website is future-proof in case I choose to add more functionality later on like a project portfolio.

## Site Design
Focus is on my name, link to my resume, and my email, in that order.
Nothing should distract from these three items.
Some additional items I'd like to add are a profile picture and links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profile.

## Site Architecture
The architecture should be cost effective, allow for rapid, agile development, and be performant.
This is also a learning experience so using a new set of technologies is a plus.
